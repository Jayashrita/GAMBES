# GAMBES
Gaussian-Mixture-Based Enhanced Sampling

In this enhanced sampling method the bias potential is estimated from a model probability distribution.
More details about the method can be found at: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07773  

The code for this algorithm can be found at GAMBES.cpp , it is designed to be a part of the bias module of PLUMED 2.6
