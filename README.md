# Gaussian-Mixture-Based Enhanced Sampling

## GAMBES

In this enhanced sampling method the bias potential is estimated from a model probability distribution (here, a Gaussian mixture model).
More details about the method can be found at: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07773  

The code for this algorithm can be found at GAMBES.cpp , it is compatible with PLUMED v2.6.
